# justtheme-for-vscode-dark README

![extension icon](/icon.png)

Definitely one of the VSC themes ever made.

Basically, it's just a dark theme with #ffc0cb used as a accent color (because I really like it).
For disclosure, I definitely forgot to change color of some things

Some time in the future, I might change token colors as well.
